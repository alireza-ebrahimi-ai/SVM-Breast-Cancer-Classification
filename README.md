# SVM Breast Cancer Classification
This repository contains a Python program that uses the numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn libraries to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for breast cancer classification.
# Usage
To run this program, first install the required libraries:

pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Then run the svm_breast_cancer.py file in a Python environment.
# Results
After running the program, a plot will be displayed showing the test data points and decision boundaries for each of the three kernels: linear, poly, and rbf. The accuracy of each model is also displayed in the plot title.
